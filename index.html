   <h1>
     Characteristics
   </h1>

   <p>
     Animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other
     living things.<br><br> Animals are <strong> eukaryotic</strong> and
     <strong>multicellular.</strong><br> Unlike plants and algae,
     which produce their own nutrients, animals are <em>heterotrophic</em>,
     feeding on organic material and digesting it internally.<br> <br>
     With very few exceptions, animals respire
      <strong style='color:red'>aerobically.</strong><br>
     All animals are <strong>motile</strong> (able to spontaneously move their bodies)
     during at least part of their life cycle, but some animals,
     such as sponges, corals, mussels, and barnacles, later become sessile.
     <br><br> The blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is unique to animals,
     (though it has been lost in some) allowing cells to be differentiated into
      <strong> specialised tissues and organs.</strong>
   </p>
 </div>

 <!---this is the third section of the HTML document--->
 <!---This section is composed of a heading <h1> and one paragraph.
 The paragraph is separated by 3 breaks into 4 segments <p>--->
 <div id="thirddivision" class='part'>
   <h1>
     Structure of animals
   </h1>

   <p>
     All animals are composed of
     <mark style="color:red"><strong>cells</strong></mark>,
      surrounded by a characteristic <strong style="color:red">extracellular
      matrix</strong> composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.<br><br>
      <strong> During development,</strong> the animal extracellular matrix forms
      a relatively <strong>flexible framework</strong> upon which cells can move
      about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex
      structures possible.<br><br>
      This may be <strong>calcified</strong>, forming structures such as shells,
      bones, and spicules.<br><br> In contrast, the cells of other
      multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in
      place by <em><strong>cell walls</em></strong>, and so develop by
      progressive growth. Animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called
     tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes
   </p>

  <!---this is the fourth section of the HTML document--->
  <!---This section is composed of a heading <h1> and one paragraph.
  The paragraph is separated by 3 breaks into 4 segments--->
 <div id="fourthdivision" class='part'>
   <h1>
     Ecology
   </h1>

   <p>
     Animals are categorised into <mark>ecological groups </mark>
     depending on how they obtain or consume organic material, including
     carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, detritivores, and parasites.
     Interactions between animals form<strong><u> complex food webs</strong>
     </u>.<br><br> In<strong> carnivorous or omnivorous species</strong>,
      <strong style="color:red">predation</strong> is a consumer-resource
      interaction where a predator feeds on <em>another organism</em>
       (called its prey).<br><br> Selective pressures imposed on one another
      lead to an <strong style="color:red">evolutionary arms</strong> race
      between predator and prey, resulting in various anti-predator<strong>
     adaptations</strong>. Almost all multicellular predators are animals.
      Some consumers use multiple methods; for example, in parasitoid wasps,
      the larvae feed<strong> on the hosts' living tissues</strong>,
      killing them in the process, but the adults primarily consume nectar from
     flowers.<br><br> Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours,
     such as <strong>hawksbill sea turtles</strong> primarily eating sponges.

  <!---this is the fifth and last section of the HTML document. It is a grid--->
  <!---The grid contain 11 items. One item at the beginning, and one at the end,
  and NINE items of animals--->

  <div class='part' id='fifthdivision'>
    <h1>
      Examples of common animals
    </h1>

    <p>
      We can't write here all Examples of animals.
      They are just few examples to illustrate children.
    </p>

    <div id='grid' >
      <div class="intro"> <!---This item appears at the beginning (in top of the grid)--->
        The WebSite shows a few examples of <strong>
         <em style='font-variant: small-caps; font-size:1.5em'> animals</em></strong>.
          It is useful for our <strong>kids</strong> to have some knowledge about
         Animal Kingdom. It can be useful for you too! Enjoy the website!
